Overview
********

The **OAK-FFC 4P PoE** baseboard uses PoE for power and connectivity, and has **4 FFC interfaces** which allows for:

- **Two 2-lane MIPI** camera modules, eg. :ref:`OAK-FFC-OV9282 <bg0250tg>` (stereo pair)
- **Two 4-lane MIPI** camera modules, eg. :ref:`OAK-FFC-IMX378 <bg0249>` RGB camera module, or additional :ref:`OAK-FFC-OV9282 <bg0250tg>` if RGB camera module is not required

To see **which cameras are compatible with this OAK FFC baseboard**, see the guide here: :ref:`OAK FFC camera modules`.
Some of camera modules have a :ref:`M12 mount <M12 mount lenses>`, so you can use different lenses to get **custom FoV** (with :ref:`wide or narrow FOV M12 lenses <M12 selectable FOV>`).

This board uses :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro` and is also compatible with RPi camera interface. For that you will need a `FFC from Arducam <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-12mp-imx477-mini-high-quality-camera-with-m12-mount-lens-and-adapter-board-for-depthai/>`__,
which converts 26-pin Luxonis camera pinout to 22 pin RPi camera pinout.

This device also supports **PoE passthrough**, so you can **daisy chain** multiple OAK-FFC 4P PoE boards. As the chip is PoE 802.3af, it can supply up to 15.4W
of power, which means you can connect up to 3 devices in a row (as each consumes ~5W of power). **Note** that if you have longer cables and/or utilize all available computation
(NN, Stereo, CV, video encoder, CPU, etc.), it might be that you could only connect 2 devices in a row.

FFC cables
**********

For FFC cables we use `Molex series 15166 <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/partSearch?query=15166>`__. Along with the OAK FFC board, we ship
**26 pin count, same-sided, 152mm** cables (part number `151660281 <https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/cable/0151660281>`__).
If you would like to use **shorter/longer FFC cables**, you can get them `here <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/deepSearch?pQuery=q%253D*%253A*%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dproductseries%253A%252215166%2522%252BOR%252Bengineeringnumber%253A%252215166%2522%2540fq%253Dcategory%253A%2522Cable%2522%2540fq%253Dcircuitsloaded%253A%252226%2522&currentQuery=contactlayouttype%3AA%2B%2528same%2Bside%2529&origin=_l1stv13w>`__.

Known errata
************

- It is not possible to power the OAK-FFC-4P-POE via the USB-C connector. So to connect through the USB-C, you will need to power via RJ45 (POE).
