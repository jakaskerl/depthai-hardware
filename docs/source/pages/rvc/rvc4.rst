AI Power Consumption
--------------------

RVC4's AI system is designed to be power-efficient and configurable to the user's needs. The AI system can be configured to run at different power levels (FPS speeds), which will affect the performance of the AI system.
The following table shows model FPS and [power consumption] at different FPS speeds:

Power measurements were taken of the whole RVC4 board during 10 second inference runs. So the AI power consumption is a bit less, as the rest of the chip (mainly CPU) is also consuming power.

Jetson comparison
-----------------

Nvidia's Jetson series is currently the de-facto edge AI platform. We tested the Jetson Orin Nano 8GB (`MSRP: $499 <https://www.arrow.com/en/products/945-13766-0007-000/nvidia>`__),
which has 40 TOPS (GPU) and 6-core ARM CPU. Below is a 1:1 comparison of RVC4 to Jetson Orin Nano 8GB, both using INT8 precision and the same image shape:

    - 142
  * - YoloV3 Tiny, BS1
    - 1342
    - 563

**Conclusion:** From results above, the **RVC4 provides 1.9x better performance** compared to the Jetson Orin Nano 8GB.

Looking at `Jetson Family Benchmarks <https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-benchmarks>`__ (at the bottom), Nvidia reports FPS for
BS32 models (Batch Size 32, so 32 images getting inferenced all at once). From our own tests, these numbers are realistic, however, their
BS1 models (Batch Size 1, so single image) perform ~2x worse than BS32 ones. If you want real-time performance (not +1 sec latency), you
will need to use BS1 models.

If we are only looking at **BS1 model comparison**, on average, **RVC4 provides 2.17x better performance**.

\* As the SoC is brand new, the model optimizer is still being updated, and additional layers will be added to get inferenced on accelerated blocks in the future. For Super resolution model, a few layers got inferenced on the CPU, that's why RVC4 performance was low.

Power efficiency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We also measured the power usage of both RVC4 and the Jetson Orin Nano 8GB. We ran both devices at max performance (so MAX FPS for RVC4),
and measured the power usage of the whole board. Power usage of Orin Nano fluctuates a lot, so we took the average of the power usage over 10 seconds.
We always took a model with Batch Size=1 (so a single image).

  :header-rows: 1

  * - Model name
    - RVC4 [W]
    - Jetson Orin Nano 8GB [W]

    - 9.1
    - 12

    - 10

    - 9.3
    - 11

**Conclusion:** While being 90% faster, **RVC4 is also 15% more power efficient** compared to the Jetson Orin Nano 8GB

Custom applications
-------------------

Users will have full access to the power of the RVC4:

- Easy development & deployment of **custom containerized apps** will be possible out-of-the-box via `RobotHub <https://www.luxonis.com/robothub>`__
- Develop and run fast CV pipelines on top of accelerated hardware blocks using `Halide <https://halide-lang.org/>`__
- Interface with GPIOs and communication interfaces

..
    - Full access to the **Linux OS**, which allows users to rebuilt their OS, install custom packages, add custom drivers, etc.

As RVC4 can also optionally act as a host computer, it will be able to connect other OAK :ref:`RVC2 <RVC2>`-based cameras to it.
