Overview
********

The **OAK-FFC-3P** (DM1090FFC) baseboard has **3 FFC interfaces** which allows for:

- **Two 2-lane MIPI** camera modules, eg. :ref:`OAK-FFC-OV9282 <bg0250tg>` (stereo pair)
- **One 4-lane MIPI** camera modules, eg. :ref:`OAK-FFC-IMX378 <bg0249>` RGB camera module, or additional :ref:`OAK-FFC-OV9282 <bg0250tg>` if RGB camera module is not required

.. note::
  If you would need 4 FFC interfaces, see :ref:`OAK-FFC-4P`.

Please note that only revision R1M1E1 and newer camera modules can be connected to this OAK FFC board.

To see **which cameras are compatible with this OAK FFC baseboard**, see the guide here: :ref:`OAK FFC camera modules`.
Some of camera modules have a :ref:`M12 mount <M12 mount lenses>`, so you can use different lenses to get **custom FoV** (with :ref:`wide or narrow FOV M12 lenses <M12 selectable FOV>`).

This board uses :ref:`OAK-SoM` and is also compatible with RPi camera interface. For that you will need a `FFC from Arducam <https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-12mp-imx477-mini-high-quality-camera-with-m12-mount-lens-and-adapter-board-for-depthai/>`__,
which converts 26-pin Luxonis camera pinout to 22 pin RPi camera pinout.

In addition, IMU (over SPI) sensor is also added to this OAK FFC board.

Getting started
***************

The OAK-FFC-3P is powered via USB Type-C or from a 5V, 5.5m x 2.5mm barrel jack, and interfaces to a host via USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C. With cameras and the 
:ref:`OAK-SoM <bw1099>`, total power consumption usually stays below the 900ma specification of USB 3, but Type-C power of 1.5A or greater is recommended.

Interfacing with the OAK-SoM is also possible with OAK-FFC-3P connector pads J3, J4, and J5. These pads are designed for the Amphenol/FCI 
20021121-00010T1LF or equivalent. Please refer to the schematics for pinout information.

The reset button resets the OAK-SoM only. The boot button overrides boot mode to USB boot if different boot mode is set in NOR Flash 
and `BW1099EMB <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/tree/master/SoMs/BW1099EMB/R1M0E1>`__ SoM is used.

The 5V LED indicates 5V power is present on the OAK-FFC-3P. The PG LED indicates "power good" from the OAK-SoM. The "RUN" LED indicates that the 
OAK-SoM is not in reset.

FFC cables
**********

For FFC cables we use `Molex series 15166 <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/partSearch?query=15166>`__. Along with the OAK-FFC-3P, we ship
**26 pin count, same-sided, 152mm** cables (part number `151660281 <https://www.molex.com/molex/products/part-detail/cable/0151660281>`__).
If you would like to use **shorter/longer FFC cables**, you can get them `here <https://www.molex.com/molex/search/deepSearch?pQuery=q%253D*%253A*%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dcollection%253Aimpulse%2540fq%253Dproductseries%253A%252215166%2522%252BOR%252Bengineeringnumber%253A%252215166%2522%2540fq%253Dcategory%253A%2522Cable%2522%2540fq%253Dcircuitsloaded%253A%252226%2522&currentQuery=contactlayouttype%3AA%2B%2528same%2Bside%2529&origin=_l1stv13w>`__.

Revision info
*************

USB designs with FFC camera boards contain 3 different iterations, below is a flowchart which tries to explain the design progress flow:

.. note::
  The first two revisions (**BW1092FFC** and **DM1098FFC**) were also named **F1**, and the newest revision (**DM1090FFC**) is named **F2**.
