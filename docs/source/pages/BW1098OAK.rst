Overview
********

The OAK-D baseboard has three on-board cameras which implement stereo and RGB vision, piped directly into the OAK SoM for depth 
and AI processing. The data is then output to a host via USB 3.1 Gen1 (Type-C).

OAK-D PCBA

Available despite decreasing demand, OAK-D PCBA is essentially an OAK-D without an enclosure
and instead has a heatsink. This could still be useful for some applications where
size/weight is really critical (eg. drones), and PCBA also exposes some additional connectors.

Getting started
***************

The OAK-D is powered via USB Type-C or from a 5V, 5.5m x 2.5mm barrel jack. USB3 5Gbps speeds are standard for streaming video or data 
from the device. With cameras and the :ref:`OAK-SoM`, total power consumption usually stays below the 900ma specification of USB 3, but Type-C 
power of 1.5A or greater is recommended.

Interfacing with the :ref:`OAK-SoM` is also possible with OAK-D connector pads J4, J5, and J6. These pads are designed for the Amphenol/FCI 
20021121-00010T1LF or equivalent. Please refer to the schematics for pinout information.

The reset button is not populated by default on the OAK-D, but can be added. Alternatively, the :ref:`OAK-SoM` can be reset by shorting RST to ground.

The 5V LED indicates 5V power is present on the PCBA. The PG LED indicates "power good" from the OAK-SoM. The "RUN"
LED indicates that the OAK-SoM is not in reset.
