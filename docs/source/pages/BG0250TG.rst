Overview
********

The **OAK-FFC-OV9282** is a carrier board for the Arducam PY010 :ref:`OV9282` camera module. A 26-pin FFC is used
to carry 5V power, 2-lane MIPI, I2C, and other control signals between this camera module and the controller baseboard.

People typically use a pair (2) of OAK-FFC-OV9282 to create a stereo camera pair. We previously used Sunny TG161B or AN01V32 OV9282 camera module.

Getting started
***************

Camera module compatibility is known for the Arducam PY010 OV9282 and previously used Sunny TG161B and AN01V32,
but not tested for other modules. The FFC interface is an 0.5mm pitch, 26-pin, and bottom-contact connector, across
which travels the 2-lane MIPI, 5V, I2C, camera clock, camera reset, and other optional control lines. 5V power is
regulated down and filtered as appropriate to meet the requirements of the compact camera module and OV9282.
