Getting started with OAK IoT devices
====================================

.. note::
  This tutorial is intended for `OAK-D-IoT-75 <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DM1098OBC.html>`__
  and `OAK-D-IoT-40 <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DM1092.html>`__, which both have an ESP32 on
  the board.

Code examples
#############

Code examples can be found in our `esp32-spi-message-demo <https://github.com/luxonis/esp32-spi-message-demo>`__
github repository.

Overview

Overview explained:

- :ref:`RVC2` is the SoC+circuitry on the OAK camera, where you can run your pipeline
- :ref:`RVC2` is connected to the host (eg. PC)
- :ref:`RVC2` can communicate `Messages <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/>`__ with the ESP32 via SPI (using `SPIOut <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/spi_out/>`__ / `SPIOut <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/spi_in/>`__ node)
- ESP32 can receive these messages using the `depthai-spi-api <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-spi-api>`__ library (which is an `ESP-IDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>`__ component).
- On ESP32 you can run post-processing of the messages and optionally send the results to a server (if connected to a WiFi network) or to a Bluetooth device (eg. a smartphone)

Usually, developers would develop their solution with the device connected via USB-C, and use potentially use OTA updates via ESP32 in production.

Limitations
###########

Currently, the bottleneck for some use cases is the SPI throughput, which is about **1MB/s** (8Mbps).
This means that you can stream frames over the SPI, just not high-resolution / unencoded streams.

As of now we only support `ESP-IDF <https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf>`__ as the development framework. In the future,
we might support `Arduino <https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32>`__.

Common use cases for the ESP32
##############################

**TL;DR:**

- Sending metadata results (spatial coordinates, NN results, tracklets etc.)
- OTA updates
- Capturing and streaming video/images
- System information logging
- Sending data to the cloud (eg. AWS/Azure/GCP or any other IOT platform)
- Sending data to a Bluetooth device (eg. smartphone)

**Explained in more detail:**

- You could run spatial object detections and/or object tracking pipeline on the VPU and send tracklets with spatial data over the SPI to the ESP32. On ESP32 you could run some simple filtering and/or NN result decoding and then send final results to the cloud
- ESP32 can also flash DepthAI bootloader and/or pipeline, which means OTA (over-the-air) updates are supported.
- We have an example for both sending a `whole image <https://github.com/luxonis/esp32-spi-message-demo/tree/main/jpeg_demo>`__ and `part of an image <https://github.com/luxonis/esp32-spi-message-demo/tree/main/image_part>`__ through the SPI from the VPU to the ESP32
- Pipeline on the VPU could be configured to send system information (using `SystemLogger <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/system_logger/>`__ node) to the ESP32 which would forward them to a logging platform
- ESP32 also has Bluetooth capabilities, so you could forward the data from the ESP32 to a smartphone

How to get started with the development
#######################################

#. Install the **ESP-IDF**, `instructions here <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step>`__.
#. After setting up the `environmental variables <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#step-4-set-up-the-environment-variables>`__, you can build any demo from the `esp32-spi-message-demo <https://github.com/luxonis/esp32-spi-message-demo>`__ repository with :code:`idf.py build`.
#. After building, you can flash your ESP32 using :code:`idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` (replace :code:`PORT` with the ESP32 port, eg. :code:`/dev/ttyUSB0`). You might need to change the permission of the port with :code:`sudo chmod 777 PORT` so idf.py can access it.
#. After flashing the ESP32, you can start the pipeline. If you have used a demo ESP32 code, you should run the corresponding python script that's inside the demo folder.
