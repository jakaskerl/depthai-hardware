Overview
********

OAK-D-Lite takes the affordability idea and pushes it one step forward. By having the same SpatialAI functionality as OAK-D with a smaller weight and
form factor, it gives you the opportunity to create all sorts of projects.

It is meant to be used by anyone, anywhere. The Swiss Army Knife of Computer Vision.

OAK-D vs OAK-D-Lite
*******************

OAK-D-Lite is smaller, lighter and uses less power; compared to OAK-D. The main differences are:

- Mono cameras have lower resolution (640x480 instead of 1280x800)
- Initial versions of OAK-D-Lites (KickStarter batch) had no `IMU <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/imu/>`__. Current batches have BMI270.
- There is no power jack, as most users just used the USB-C for power delivery, which provides 900mA at 5V and is enough for most use-cases. However some functions (e.g. inference, video encoding) can lead to large current spikes, so there is a chance hosts like RPi won't be able to provide enough power. In that case, you should use :ref:`Y-adapter`.

Additionally, the more technical differences are the following:

- :ref:`RVC2` chip-down design, instead of connecting the :ref:`OAK-SoM` to the baseboard (like it is done on OAK-D)
- In collaboration with ArduCam, we developed custom camera sensor connectors, which are shorter and take up less space

Fixed-focus vs Auto-focus
*************************

When ordering the OAK-D-Lite, you can select whether you want :code:`Fixed-focus` (FF) or :code:`Auto-focus` (AF) **on the
color camera**. You should select FF if you are mounting OAK camera to something that vibrates. You should select AF when
you need things closer than ~50cm to be in focus. More information can be found at :ref:`Auto-Focus vs Fixed-Focus`.

Dimensions and Weight
*********************

* Width: 91 mm

Power consumption
*****************

* Standby: 0.6 W
* Running depthai_demo.py: 4 W
* Max consumption: 4.5 W

Occasional power spikes of 2W may occur when running videoEncoder and/or Neural Network. OAK-D-Lite can be also powered off of USB3.

Operating temperature
*********************

More information can be found at :ref:`OAK-D-Lite temperature tests`. We have tested OAK-D-Lite with the following command which should
inflict the highest consumption:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 depthai_demo.py -enc color -s color left right depth


and after 90 minutes, we received the following temperatures:

* Enclosure: 55.7 °C (thermal image below)
* :ref:`RVC2`: 73.53 °C

The operating temperature range of the :ref:`RVC2` (die temperature) is -40 °C to 105 °C. The die temperature can get to about +35°C from the ambient 
temperature. Note that the stable image temperature of the camera sensor is 0 °C to +50 °C (operating temperature -30 °C to +70 °C).
