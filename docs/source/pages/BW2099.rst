Overview
********

The **OAK-SoM-Pro** is a System on Module (SoM) designed for integration into top-level systems with
a need for a low-power, high performance, real-time AI, and depth perception. It is ideal for use in industrial automation, robotics, and security systems.
The OAK-SoM-Pro interfaces with the system through two 10-Gbps-rated 100-pin board-to-board mezzanine connector which carries
all signal I/O as well as 5v input. The on-board SMPS system regulates the 5V input and provides all necessary digital and analog power.
An auxiliary power port is offered to interface without connection to a baseboard.

**OAK-SoM-Pro comes in two variants**: :ref:`RVC2` based and :ref:`RVC3` based SoM.
:ref:`RVC3` provides quadcore ARM CPU, INT8 quantization, and enhanced stereo depth perception compared to the :ref:`RVC2`.

        **Devices that use OAK-SoM-Pro MX**

        All devices that have SoM on-board are also open-source. You could redesign them, for example to change stereo baseline. If you
        are interested in integrating DepthAI (via SoM) into your product, see :ref:`documentation here <integrating_depthai_into_products>`.

        **OAK-SoM-Pro-S3** has an :ref:`RVC3` and **quadcore ARM CPU** on board. It was designed to have the same dimensions and pinout as the :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro`, so it can easily
        replace the :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro` on OAK cameras that use it (:ref:`list here <OAK-SoM-Pro>`).

        Note that for **OAK POE devices** (:ref:`OAK-D-PoE`, :ref:`OAK-1-PoE`) this **won't work**, as S1/S2 OAK POE devices use an PCIe to ETH bridge which
        isn't (yet) supported by RVC3 (kernel). RVC3 has ETH PHY already on the SoC, so S3 PoE devices won't use the same bridge.

        It was primarily designed for evaluation and backwards compatibility.
        For new products, we would suggest using :ref:`dm3399` (differences below).
