Overview
********

The **OAK-D Pro** is an upgraded version of :ref:`OAK-D`, featuring an **IR laser dot projector** (active stereo) and **IR illumination LED** (for
night-vision). OAK-D Pro is from the :ref:`Series 2 of OAK cameras <OAK series 2>`. It's smaller and lighter than the OAK-D.

Compared to the :ref:`OAK-D S2`, the only difference is the dot projector/illumination LED (:ref:`Pro aspect <Pro version>` of the version).
Otherwise, the PCB and enclosure are the same.

Due to the large power consumption of dot projector/illumination LED, a :ref:`Y-adapter` **is required** when using these functions!

Looking for the **Wide FOV** OAK-D Pro? You can find it :ref:`here <dm9098prow>`.
