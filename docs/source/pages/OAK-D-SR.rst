Overview
********

The **OAK-D SR** (Short Range) was designed to provide an accurate close-in depth perception. It's ideal for application like bin picking/pack, for pick and place
machines, quality control/automated manufacturing, robotics arms, and more.

It has two :ref:`OV9782` global shutter color cameras, that are used as the stereo pair.

The OAK-D SR leverages our :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro <bw2099>` to make a overall compact design. The use of the SoM reduces the
design's scale, making it easier to mount or fit in various robotic processes. The design is also `open-source <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/tree/master/DM2080_OAK_D_SR>`__,
allowing for any necessary `modifications <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/guides/integrating_depthai_into_products.html>`__.
The data is output to a host USB 3.1 Gen1 (Type-C).

  Getting started
  ***************

  The OAK-D is powered via USB Type-C or from a 5V, 5.5m x 2.5mm barrel jack. USB3 5Gbps speeds are standard for streaming video or data 
  from the device. With cameras and the :ref:`OAK-SoM`, total power consumption usually stays below the 900ma specification of USB 3, but Type-C 
  power of 1.5A or greater is recommended.

  Interfacing with the :ref:`OAK-SoM` is also possible with OAK-D connector pads J4, J5, and J6. These pads are designed for the Amphenol/FCI 
  20021121-00010T1LF or equivalent. Please refer to the schematics for pinout information.

  The reset button is not populated by default on the OAK-D, but can be added. Alternatively, the :ref:`OAK-SoM`can be reset by shorting RST to ground.

  The 5V LED indicates 5V power is present on the PCBA. The PG LED indicates "power good" from the OAK-SoM. The "RUN"
  LED indicates that the OAK-SoM is not in reset.
