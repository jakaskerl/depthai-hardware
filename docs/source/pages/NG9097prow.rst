Overview
********

The **OAK-D Pro W PoE** has **Wide Field of View (FOV) cameras** and features an **IR laser dot projector** (active stereo) and **IR illumination LED** (for
night-vision). The OAK-D Pro W PoE is from the :ref:`Series 2 of OAK cameras <OAK series 2>`.

Compared to the :ref:`OAK-D S2 PoE`, the only differences are:

- IR laser dot projector and IR illumination LED (:ref:`Pro aspect <Pro version>` of the version)
- Wide FOV cameras (:ref:`W aspect <Wide FOV>` of the version)

It also has industrial **M12 PoE connector** (instead of RJ45) and additionally features an
**M8 connector for IO connectivity**; USB2 (D+, D-), camera IOs (FSIN, STROBE), power, and one auxiliary GPIO.
