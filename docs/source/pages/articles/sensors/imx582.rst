======

IMX582 is a 48MP rolling shutter color image sensor. It's the highest resolution sensor that depthai
currently supports. It's integrated into the :ref:`ng9096max`.

Currently the full resolution (THE_48_MP) is center cropped to **5312x6000 due to ISP width limit**.
So at the moment the image at full resolution (THE_48_MP) has narrower HFOV than the camera actually is (see image below),
just because of this limitation on line width.


IMX582 QBC
##########

QBC (Quad Bayer Coding) remosaic is computed on the sensor itself. Physical pixel layout (QBC) is on the left,
and remosaic'ed pixel layout is on the right, which is the standard Bayer layout.

  :target: https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4088675984/quad-bayer-vs-quad-pixel-af-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-how-they-differ

When binning on QBC sensor (eg. 4000x3000 resolution), sensor just combines the two adjacent pixels into one (eg. 4 green pixels into 1 big green pixel).
The result is a binned image that has better `Image Quality (IQ) <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/tutorials/image_quality/>`__
compared to standard bayer sensor (eg. :ref:`IMX378`), where binning will reduce image quality, as it has to jump over pixels to combine those
of the same color filter, which results in less sharp images.
