Overview
********

The RaspberryPi Adapter Camera (BW0253_R0M0E0) is an adapter board to allow the Raspberry Pi HQ camera to physically interface to the DepthAI RGB camera port on 
the :ref:`OAK-FFC-3P-OG <bw1098ffc>`.

This allows using DepthAI with all sorts of lens combinations, including variable zoom, variable focus, and even with a telescope.

General information
*******************

* Onboard 5V to 3.3V regulation
* Level shifting of DepthAI 1.8V-native IO to 3.3V-native RPI IO
* Same board outline size as RPI cam v2

Getting started
***************

Attach 0.5mm, 26 circuit, same-side contact FFC between DepthAI and BW0253_R0M0E0. Use the standard RPI FFC which is included with 
the RPI cameras.
