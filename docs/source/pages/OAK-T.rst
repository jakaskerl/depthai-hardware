Overview
********

The **OAK-T** (OAK Thermal) is our first camera with a **thermal sensor** and a color image sensor.

When fusing thermal frames, color frames, and AI models, you can create a wide variety of applications in different fields, such as:

- **Agriculture**: Health crop, detect irrigation issues, detect pests, livestock health monitoring, etc.
- **Industrial**: Detect overheating, detect leaks, detect fires, etc.
- **Security**: Detect intruders (night vision), detect fires, etc.
- **Transportation**: Detect pedestrians, vehicles, bicycles for analytics and traffic optimization...

It leverages our :ref:`OAK-SoM-Pro <bw2099>` to make an overall compact design. The use of the SoM reduces the
design's scale, making it easier to mount or fit anywhere seamlessly. The design will also be open-source when we verify the hardware design.

Thermal perception
******************

Thermal cameras detect infrared radiation, which is emitted by all objects based on their temperature. We use a special IR-capable lens to focus the infrared light emitted by all of the objects/scene in view,
which is then scanned by an array of infrared-detector elements ("pixels") in the camera.

Thermal perception range
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thermal perception range is similar to color camera's range, it mostly depends on the object's size and temperature. For example, with
you can easily detect a large building even from 1km away, but you won't be able to detect a small animal from that distance.

The following table shows the approximate thermal perception range for different object sizes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Object
     - Size
     - Detection
     - Recognition
     - Identification
   * - Human
     - 1.8m x 0.5m
     - 200m
     - 50m
     - 25m
   * - Car
     - 4.5m x 2m
     - 500m
     - 125m
     - 63m

The DRI (Detection, Recognition, Identification) ranges are based on the `Johnson's criteria <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%27s_criteria>`__,
which is a standard for optical systems. Specifications are as follows:

- **Detection**: The ability to notice that something is there, but without the ability to identify it
- **Recognition**: Being able to classify the type of object (like distinguishing a car from a truck)
- **Identification**: The capability to specify the exact nature of the object (like determining the make and model of a car).

Power consumption
*****************

Most of the power is consumed by the :ref:`RVC2 <RVC2>`, so the power consumption mostly depends on the workload of the chip:

- Base consumption + PoE circuitry + camera streaming: 3W - 3.5W
- Thermal sensor: Up to 1W
- AI subsystem consumption: Up to 1W
- Stereo depth pipeline subsystem: Up to 0.5W
- Video Encoder subsystem: Up to 0.5W

So the total power consumption can be up to ~6.5W if you are using all the features at 100% at the same time. To reduce the power consumption,
you can reduce FPS of the whole pipeline - that way, subsystems won't be utilized at 100% and will consume less power.
